ORC TODO (Bug fixes and improvements as I notice them!):

Modbus:
1. Better queue management - at the moment an offline device can flood the queue with unresponded requests, limit per dice requests in modbus library!
2. More config (1.5 stop bits option, timout value)
3. Show stats - queue size, errors, dropped requests (queue full) etc
