# Project Planning

## üöÄ Vision & Purpose
The Open Reactor Control System aims to provide a unified control platform for bioreactor systems with robust control and monitoring capabilities. It solves the challenge of reliable, precise bioreactor control by implementing a dual microcontroller architecture that separates user interface/high-level control from real-time sensor monitoring and control functions. The system provides deterministic, real-time monitoring and control of critical bioreactor parameters including dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, gas flow, and stirring speed, enabling reliable and reproducible fermentation and cell culture operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

   - User inputs via web interface on System Controller
   - External commands via MQTT and Modbus interfaces
2. Processed by specialized control components:
   - Real-time control loops in I/O Controller (PID control, cascade control)
   - Data formatting and validation in System Controller
3. Results stored in multiple storage components:
   - SD card for logging events and sensor data
   - EEPROM for configuration data and calibration values
4. Accessed via:
   - Web interface dashboard with real-time data visualization
   - File manager for log downloads
